#### *Profile ane Education*

I am an Infectious Disease Epidemiologist with more than 10 years of experience in the field.

My background includes an MD at UPTC in Colombia, a Masters in Public Health at Universidad Nacional de Colombia and a PhD on Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London in the UK. I did a postdoc with the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium in the UK. In 2017 I was awarded the MRC Rutherford Fund Fellowship from the UK Reseacrh and Innovation.

<br />

#### _Academic Positions_

I hold a Research Fellow position in the [MRC Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/zulma.cucunuba)  at Imperial College London in the UK. I also hold an academic appointment as Assistant Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology in the Department of Clinical Epidemiology at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Colombia.

<br />

#### *Research Focus*

My research focuses on using statistic and mathematical methods to understand the determinants of the spread of infection diseases and the impact of control strategies, with a particular focus in Latin America. 

During 2020-21 my research has heavily focused on COVID-19 impact and control in Latin America. But, over the past 10 years, I have worked on other topics such as: vector bone diseases including Chagas disease, Zika, Chikungunya and Malaria, emerging infections and epidemic response and vaccine preventable diseases.

I am an avid R enthusiast for epidemic analytics and a member of the [R Epidemics Consortium (RECON)](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/people/).
